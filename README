FlashQuake
=======================
Port created by Kristian Johansson (kristian@soft.se)

## License ##
Same license as the original Quake 1 source released by ID Software
See seperate files in c folder

## Build ##
1. Run make
2. Might have to create a "objects" and "swc" folder to compile
3. Compile the quake.swc with the as code and your done.

No data files are included, you have to download Quake 1 Shareware, extract all files in the .pak file.

Couldn't get the program to run with the pak file, not enough memory.

## Other ##
No sound and the controls are a little crazy. But I don't have much time to put on this
the next couple of weeks so I release the source if anyone want to continue and contribute. Will
do my best to get this as complete as possible.
